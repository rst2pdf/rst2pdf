Introduction
------------

This document explains how to use rst2pdf version 0.3. Here is the very short version::


  rst2pdf.py mydocument.txt -o mydocument.pdf

That will, as long as mydocument.txt is a valid Restructured Text (ReST) 
document, produce a file called mydocument.pdf which is a PDF 
version of your document.

Of course, that means you just used default styles and settings. If it 
looks good enough for you, then you may stop reading this document, 
because you are done with it. If you are reading this in a PDF,
it was generated using those default settings.

However, if you want to customize the output, or are just curious to see
what can be done, let´s continue.

-----------------

Headers and Footers
-------------------

ReST supports headers and footers, using the header and footer directive::

  .. header::

     This will be at the top of every page.

Often, you may want to put a page number there, or a section name.The following
magic tokens will be replaced (More will be added as rst2pdf evolves):

:###Page###: Replaced by the current page number.

Styles
------

You can style paragraphs with a style using the class directive::

  .. class:: special

  This paragraph is special.

  This one is not.

Or inline styles using custom interpreted roles::

   .. role:: redtext

   I like color :redtext:`red`.

For more information about this, please check the ReST docs.

The only special thing about using rst2pdf here is the syntax of
the stylesheet. 

You can make rst2pdf print the default stylesheet:

  rst2pdf --print-stylesheet

If you want to add styles, just take the standard stylesheet, 
modify it and pass it with the -s option::

  rst2pdf mydoc.txt -s mystyles.txt


-----------------

StyleSheet Syntax
-----------------

It´s a JSON file with two elements in it::

  "fontsAlias" : {
    "stdFont": "Helvetica",
    "stdBold": "Helvetica-Bold",
    "stdItalic": "Helvetica-Oblique",
    "stdBoldItalic": "Helvetica-BoldOblique",
    "stdMono": "Courier"
  },

This defines the fonts used in the styles. You can use, for example, Helvetica 
directly in a style, but if later you want to use another font all through
your document, you will haveto change it in each style. So, I suggest you
use aliases.

The standard PDF fonts are these:

  Times_Roman
  Times-Bold
  Times-Italic
  Times-Bold-Italic
  Helvetica
  Helvetica_Bold
  Helvetica-Oblique
  Helvetica-Bold-Oblique
  Courier
  Courier-Bold
  Courier-Oblique
  Courier-Bold-Oblique
  Symbol
  Zapf-Dingbats

Reportlab supports embedding TrueType fonts, but rst2pdf has no interface for it yet.

Then you have a list of [ stylename, styleproperties ]. For example::

    ["normal" , {
      "parent": "base",
      "language": "EN"
    }],

This means that the style called "normal" inherits style "base". So, each property 
not defined in the normal style will be taken from the base style. Also, it defines 
the language to be english, only useful if you enable hyphenation.

I suggest you do not remove any style from the default stylesheet. Add or modify at
will, though.

If your document requires a style that is not defined in your styleheet, it will 
print a warning and use bodytext instead.
