Requirements: PyQt4, poppler-qt4, rst2pdf, pygments, simplejson (if your python < 2.6).

Building instructions:

1) Enter the pypoppler folder

2) edit configure.py, specifically, I had to change 
   makefile.extra_include_dirs so it could find the 
   popplerqt4 and Qt includes.

3) run configure.py && make

4) Leave the pypoppler folder, and run python main.py
