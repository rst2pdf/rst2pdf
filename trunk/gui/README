Requirements: PyQt4, poppler-qt4, rst2pdf, pygments, simplejson.

Building instructions:

1) Enter the pypoppler folder

2) Create an empty __init__.py in the pypoppler folder.

3) edit configure.py, specifically, I had to change 
   makefile.extra_include_dirs so it could find the 
   popplerqt4 and Qt includes.

4) Run python main.py
