NAME
       rst2pdf - Convert reStructuredText documents to PDF

SYNOPSIS
       rst2pdf [options] [input]

DESCRIPTION
       The usual way of creating PDF from reStructuredText (ReST) is by going through LaTeX.
       The rst2pdf utility provides an alternative by producing PDF directly using the ReportLab
       library.

OPTIONS

-h, --help  
                    Show this help message and exit
-o FILE, --output=FILE  
                    Write the PDF to FILE
-s STYLESHEETS  
                    A comma-separated list of custom stylesheets.
                    Default=""
-c, --compressed  
                    Create a compressed PDF. Default=False
--print-stylesheet  
                    Print the default stylesheet and exit
--font-folder=FOLDER  
                    Search this folder for fonts. (Deprecated)
--font-path=FOLDERLIST  
                    A colon-separated list of folders to search for fonts.
                    Default=""
-l LANG, --language=LANG  
                    Language to be used for hyphenation. Default="en_US"

--smart-quotes=VALUE  Try to convert ASCII quotes, ellipsis and dashes to
                      the typographically correct equivalent. For details,
                      read `Smart quotes`_. Default="0"

The possible values are:
    
    0
        Suppress all transformations. (Do nothing.)
    1
        Performs default SmartyPants transformations: quotes (including ``backticks'' -style), em-dashes, and ellipses. "--" (dash dash) is used to signify an em-dash; there is no support for en-dashes.
    2
        Same as smarty_pants="1", except that it uses the old-school typewriter shorthand for dashes: "--" (dash dash) for en-dashes, "---" (dash dash dash) for em-dashes.
    3
        Same as smarty_pants="2", but inverts the shorthand for dashes: "--" (dash dash) for em-dashes, and "---" (dash dash dash) for en-dashes.


--fit-literal-mode=MODE
                    What todo when a literal is too wide. One of

-b LEVEL, --break-level=LEVEL  
                    Maximum section level that starts in a new page.
                    Default: 0
--inline-links      Shows target between parenthesis instead of active
                    link
-q, --quiet  
                    Print less information.
-v, --verbose  
                    Print debug information.
--very-verbose  
                    Print even more debug information.
