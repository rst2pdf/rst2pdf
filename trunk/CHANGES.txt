-----------

* Degrade more gracefully when one or more wordaxe hyphenators are
  broken (currently DWC is the broken one)

  markup, for instance).
* New stylesheet no-compact-lists to make lists... less compact
* SVG images now handle % as a width unit correctly.
* Implemented issue 127: support images in PDF format. Right now they 
  are rasterized, so it's not ideal. Perhaps something better will come up

  it probably makes the output look worse in some cases when using that.

* Improved command line parsing and stylesheet loading (guess
  extension like latest rst2latex does)

* For Issue 109: missing styles are not a fatal error
* Issue 117: TOCs with more than 6 levels now supported (raised limit to 9, which
