'''
preprocess is a rst2pdf extension module (invoked by -e preprocess
on the rst2pdf command line.

There is a testcase for this file at rst2pdf/tests/test_preprocess.txt

This preprocesses the source text file before handing it to docutils.

This module serves two purposes:

1) It demonstrates the technique and can be a starting point for similar
   user-written processing modules; and

2) It provides a simplified syntax for documents which are targeted only
   at rst2pdf, rather than docutils in general.

The design goal of "base rst2pdf" is to be completely compatible with
docutils, such that a file which works as a PDF can also work as HTML,
etc.

Unfortunately, base docutils is a slow-moving target, and does not
make this easy.  For example, SVG images do not work properly with
the HTML backend unless you install a patch, and docutils has no
concept of page breaks or additional vertical space (other than
the <hr>).

So, while it would be nice to have documents that render perfectly
with any backend, this goal is hard to achieve for some documents,
and once you are restricted to a particular transformation type,
then you might as well have a slightly nicer syntax for your source
document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Preprocessor extensions:

All current extensions except style occupy a single line in the
source file.

``.. include::``

    Processes the include file as well.  An include file may
    either be a restructured text file, OR may be an RSON or
    JSON stylesheet.  The determination is made by trying to
    parse it as RSON.  If it passes, it is a stylesheet; if not,
    well, we'll let the docutils parser have its way with it.

``.. page::``

    Is translated into a raw PageBreak.

``.. space::``

    Is translated into a raw Spacer.  If only one number given, is
    used for vertical space.  This is the canonical use case, since
    horizontal space is ignored anyway!

``.. style::``

    Allows you to create in-line stylesheets.  As with other
    restructured text components, the stylesheet data must
    be indented.  Stylesheets are in RSON or JSON.

``.. widths::``

    creates a new table style (based on table or the first
    non-numeric token) and creates a class using that style
    specifically for the next table in the document. (Creates
    a .. class::, so you must specify .. widths:: immediately
    before the table it applies to.   Allows you to set the
    widths for the table, using percentages.

``SingleWordAtLeftColumn``

    If a single word at the left column is surrounded by
    blank lines, the singleword style is automatically applied to
    the word.  This is a workaround for the broken interaction
    between docutils subtitles and bibliographic metadata.  (I
    found that docutils was referencing my subtitles from inside
    the TOC, and that seemed silly.  Perhaps there is a better
    workaround at a lower level in rst2pdf.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Preprocessor operation:

The preprocessor generates a file that has the same name as the source
file, with .build_temp. embedded in the name, and then passes that
file to the restructured text parser.

This file is left on the disk after operation, because any error
messages from docutils will refer to line numbers in it, rather than
in the original source, so debugging could be difficult if the
file were automatically removed.
