NOTE:  THIS IS A HUGE HACK HACK HACK

All I did was take the wrap() method from the stock reportlab TOC generator,
and make the minimal changes to make it work on MY documents in rst2pdf.

History:

    The reportlab TOC generator adds nice dots between the text and the page number.
    The rst2pdf one does not.

    A closer examination reveals that the rst2pdf one probably deliberately stripped
    this code, because the reportlab implementation only allowed a single TOC, and
    this is unacceptable for at least some rst2pdf users.

    There are other differences in the rst2pdf one I don't understand.  This module
    is a hack to add back dots between the lines. Maybe at some point we can figure
    out if this is right, or how to support dots in the TOC in the main code.

    Mind you, the original RL implementation is a complete hack in any case:

       - It uses a callback to a nested function which doesn't even bother to
         assume the original enclosing scope is available at callback time.
         This leads it to do crazy things like eval()

       - It uses a single name in the canvas for the callback function
         (this is what kills multiple TOC capability) when it would be
         extremely easy to generate a unique name.
