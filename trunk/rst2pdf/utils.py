class MetaHelper(type):
    ''' MetaHelper is designed to generically enable a few of the benefits of
        using metaclasses by encapsulating some of the complexity of setting
        them up.

        If a base class uses MetaHelper (by assigning __metaclass__ = MetaHelper),
        then that class (and its metaclass inheriting subclasses) can control
        class creation behavior by defining a couple of helper functions.

        1) A base class can define a _classpreinit function.  This function
           is called during __new__ processing of the class object itself,
           but only during subclass creation (not when the class defining
           the _classpreinit is itself created).

           The subclass object does not yet exist at the time _classpreinit
           is called.  _classpreinit accepts all the parameters of the
           __new__ function for the class itself (not the same as the __new__
           function for the instantiation of class objects!) and must return
           a tuple of the same objects.  A typical use of this would be to
           modify the class bases before class creation.

        2) Either a base class or a subclass can define a _classinit() function.
           This function will be called immediately after the actual class has
           been created, and can do whatever setup is required for the class.
           Note that every base class (but not every subclass) which uses
           MetaHelper MUST define _classinit, even if that definition is None.

         MetaHelper also places an attribute into each class created with it.
         _baseclass is set to None if this class has no superclasses which
         also use MetaHelper, or to the first such MetaHelper-using baseclass.
         _baseclass can be explicitly set inside the class definition, in
         which case MetaHelper will not override it.
    '''

        # uses MetaHelper, or None if no such base exists.
