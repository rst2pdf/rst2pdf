- When a bulleted list has a bulleted sub-list,

- There is more vertical space after this line

     - (sublist element)

     - (another)

- than before this line.

This may or may not be desired behavior, but it was counterintuitive to me.
I expected the sublist to bind more tightly to the element above than the
element below.
