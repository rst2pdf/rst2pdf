.. test_footnotes documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to test_footnotes's documentation!
==========================================

Sphinx seems to use a per-file footnote counter.
I would much prefer to use a per-project one.
So, created a test and posted in sphin-dev, we'll see what happens.

   :maxdepth: 2
