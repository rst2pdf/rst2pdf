   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to test_glossary's documentation!

   environment
         A structure where information about all documents under the root is
         saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled
         after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
         and parse new and changed documents.

   source directory
         The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
         source files for one Sphinx project.
