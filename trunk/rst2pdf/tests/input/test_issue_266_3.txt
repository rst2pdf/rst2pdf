Figures with scaled PDF images and borders
===========================================

This test combines something that test_vectorpdf (reading a partial page)
was doing with something that test_issue_266 (scale so large that it has to be 
scaled back down) was doing, and something test_issue_265 (test with borders)
was doing, using the vectorpdf extension ("-e vectorpdf").

Basic image:

.. figure:: ../output/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130

Scaled up a bit:

.. figure:: ../output/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130
   :scale: 150%

Scaled up a lot:

.. figure:: ../output/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130
   :scale: 300%


Repeat the whole thing as a figure, with ``with-border`` class:

Basic image:

.. class:: with-border
.. figure:: ../output/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130
   :align: center

Scaled up a bit:

.. class:: with-border
.. figure:: ../output/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130
   :scale: 150%
   :align: center

Scaled up a lot:

.. class:: with-border
.. figure:: ../output/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130
   :scale: 300%
   :align: center
