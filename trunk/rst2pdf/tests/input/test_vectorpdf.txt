PDF Vector image test
=======================

To use this test, you need to do::

    svn co http://pdfrw.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pdfrw

somewhere on your Python path.  For testing, I just do this
right inside the rst2pdf/tests subdirectory

.. image:: images/text_and_vectors_001.pdf
        :align: center


This should bring in an image.  Probably needs a lot of
work to be generally useful.
