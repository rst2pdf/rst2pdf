PDF Vector image test
=======================

At the time of this writing, the rst2pdf/extensions/vectorpdf
directory has svn:externals set to bring in pdfrw.  If this
ever changes, then to use this test, you might need to do::

    svn co http://pdfrw.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pdfrw

somewhere on your Python path.  For testing, I just do this
right inside the rst2pdf/tests subdirectory

.. image:: images/text_and_vectors_001.pdf
        :align: center


This should bring in an image.  Probably needs a lot of
work to be generally useful.
