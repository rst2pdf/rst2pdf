PDF partial image scaling test
===============================

This test combines something that test_vectorpdf (reading a partial page)
was doing with something that test_isue_266 (scale so large that it has to be 
scaled back down) was doing, using the vectorpdf extension ("-e vectorpdf").

Basic image:

.. image:: images/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130

Scaled up a bit:

.. image:: images/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130
   :scale: 150%

Scaled up a lot:

.. image:: images/demo.pdf#page=6#viewrect=250,330,270,130
   :scale: 300%
