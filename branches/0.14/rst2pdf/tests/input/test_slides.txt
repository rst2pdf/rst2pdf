This is my first slide
----------------------

* It has, of course, items in it

* More than one item

    1. Numbered lists, too

This is my second slide
-----------------------

rst2pdf can display code nicely:

.. code-block:: python

    for x in range(7):
        print "cute!"

This is my third slide
----------------------

Also, you can use math!

.. math:: 

    \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3}

That is *not* an image.

This is my 4th slide
--------------------

Other features include:

* Images, including SVG

* Tables

* Font embedding (Type1 and TTF)

* Extensible

* Background (like this one)

* Page transitions
