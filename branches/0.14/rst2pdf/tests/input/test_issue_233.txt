Section 1
==========

This file only has lots of sections in order to make lots of pages visible.

The idea of the header/footer containers is as follows:

For a header or footer (well, for the whole body really, but to start with,
for a header or footer), a container could be used to keep two or three
flowables (paragraphs, images, etc.) at the same vertical position.

The 'classes' passed to the container define whether the two paragraphs
are left and center, left and right, right and center, etc.  Another
option, useful for printed PDFs is 'outside' and 'inside' instead of
'left' and 'right'.

For this example PDF, every paragraph which starts with the same Cx
number should be at the same vertical alignment, and should be at the
horizontal alignment specified in the paragraph.
