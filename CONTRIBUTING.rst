Contributing to rst2pdf
=======================

This project is actively maintained and contributions from developers of all levels are very, very welcome. We recommend opening an issue before starting work on anything big so that we can discuss with you any details that might be relevant - but an issue is not required. Changes are welcome however they arrive :)

Start by making sure the project is running from source - instructions in the `README <README.rst>`_ for setting up local project.

Open an Issue
=============

Issues are always welcome here! Please give as much detail as you can; small replication cases showing what doesn't work help us a lot - bonus points if you can turn that into a test! (more on testing later)

Documentation Changes
=====================

Documentation fixes are *at least* as valuable as code ones. The manual is in the file `doc/manual.rst <doc/manual.rst>`_ and gets converted to both PDF and HTML for https://rst2pdf.org. Please go ahead and open a pull request for each of the changes you think we need.

Open a Pull Request
===================

We love pull requests!

Please open a pull request if you have changes/fixes/improvements to share. This project is for all of us and we welcome changes. Your PR should include:

* A detailed description of what is being changed and importantly *why*.
* Tests to cover the new feature, including reference PDFs.
* An update to the manual if needed.

Local Development
=================
