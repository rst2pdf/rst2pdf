Overview
========

The original idea was to parse ASCII art images, embedded in reST documents and
output an image. This would mean that simple illustrations could be embedded as
ASCII art in the reST source and still look nice when converted to e.g. HTML.

Since then the aafigure application also grew into a standalone application
providing a command line tool for ASCII art to image conversion.

Installation
============

The package
-----------
To install aafigure, you need to have administrator rights on your system (be
root). Type ``python setup.py install`` to install aafigure.

This installs a package that can be used from python (``import aafigure``) and
a command line script called ``aafigure``.

The Python Imaging Library (PIL) needs to be installed when support for bitmap
formats is desired and it will need ReportLab for PDF output.

The docutils plugin
-------------------
The docutils-aafigure extension depends on the aafigure package also requires
``setuptools`` (often packaged as ``python-setuptools``) and docutils itself
(0.5 or newer) must be installed.

After that, the ``aafigure`` directive will be available.


Implementation
==============

Files in the ``aafigure`` package:

``aafigure.py``
    ASCII art parser. This is the main module.

``aa.py``
    ASCII art output backend. Intended for tests, not for the end user.

``pdf.py``
    PDF output backend. Depends on reportlab.

``pil.py``
    Bitmap output backend. Using PIL, it can write PNG, JPEG and more formats.

``svg.py``
    SVG output backend.


Files in the ``docutils`` directory:

``aafigure_directive.py``
    Implements the ``aafigure`` Docutils directive that takes these
    ASCII art figures and generates a drawing.

The ``aafigure`` module contains code to parse ASCII art figures and create
a list of of shapes. The different output modules can walk through a list of
shapes and write image files.


Usage
=====
Command line tool
-----------------
::

    aafigure test.txt -t png -o test.png

The tool can also read from standard in and supports many options. Please look
at the command's help::

    aafigure --help

Within reStructured text
------------------------
::

    ./rst2html.py README.txt >README.html

This results in the ``README.html`` file and a ``.svg`` file for each
``aafigure``.

Display the resulting ``README.html`` file in a SVG capable browser. It has
been tested with Firefox 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0.


Short introduction
==================
This code in a reST document that is processed with the enhanced ``rst2html.py``
looks like this::

    .. aafigure::

        -->

Which results in an image like this:

.. aafigure::

    -->

The ``aafigure`` directive has the following options:

- ``:scale: <float>``   enlarge or shrink image

- ``:line_width: <float>``   change line with (svg only currently)

- ``:format: <str>`` choose backend/output format: 'svg', 'png', all
  bitmap formats that PIL supports can be used but only few make sense. Line
  drawings have a good compression and better quality when saved as PNG
  rather than a JPEG. The best quality will be achieved with SVG, tough not
  all browsers support this vector image format at this time.

- ``:foreground: <str>``   foreground color in the form ``#rgb`` or ``#rrggbb``

- ``:background: <str>``   background color in the form ``#rgb`` or ``#rrggbb``
  (*not* for SVG output)

- ``:fill: <str>``   fill color in the form ``#rgb`` or ``#rrggbb``

- ``:name: <str>``   use this as filename instead of the automatic generated
  name

- ``:aspect: <float>``  change aspect ratio. Effectively it is the width of the
  image that is multiplied by this factor. The default setting ``1`` is useful
  when shapes must have the same look when drawn horizontally or vertically.
  However, ``:aspect: 0.5`` looks more like the original ASCII and even smaller
  factors may be useful for timing diagrams and such. But there is a risk that
  text is cropped or is draw over an object beside it.

  The stretching is done before drawing arrows or circles, so that they are
  still good looking.

- ``:proportional: <flag>``  use a proportional font instead of a mono-spaced
  one.


Lines
-----
The ``-`` and ``|`` are normally used for lines. ``_`` and ``~`` can also be
used. They are slightly longer lines than the ``-``. ``_`` is drawn a bit
lower and ``~`` a bit upper. ``=`` gives a thicker line. The later three line
types can only be drawn horizontally.
::

  ---- |         ___  ~~~|
       | --  ___|        |    ===
                         ~~~

.. aafigure::

  ---- |         ___  ~~~|
       | --  ___|        |    ===
                         ~~~

It is also possible to draw diagonal lines. Their use is somewhat restricted
tough. Not all cases work as expected.

.. aafigure::

                                     +
      |  -  +   |  -  +   |  -  +   /               -
     /  /  /   /  /  /   /  /  /   /     --     |/| /    +
    |  |  |   +  +  +   -  -  -   /     /  \        -   \|/  |\
                                 +     +    +          +-+-+ | +
    |  |  |   +  +  +   -  -  -   \     \  /        -   /|\  |/
     \  \  \   \  \  \   \  \  \   \     --     |\| \    +
      |  -  +   |  -  +   |  -  +   \               -
                                     +

And drawing longer diagonal lines with different angles looks ugly...

.. aafigure::

    +      |
     \    /
      \  /
       --


Arrows
------
Arrow styles are::

    --->   | | | | | |
    ---<   | | | | | |
    ---o   ^ V v o O #
    ---O
    ---#

.. aafigure::

    --->   | | | | | |
    ---<   | | | | | |
    ---o   ^ V v o O #
    ---O
    ---#

Boxes
-----
Boxes are automatically draw when the edges are made with ``+``, filled
boxes are made with ``X`` (must be at least two units high or wide).
It is also possible to make rounded edges in two ways::

    +-----+   XXX  /--\     --   |
    |     |   XXX  |  |    /    /
    +-----+   XXX  \--/   |   --

.. aafigure::

    +-----+   XXX  /--\     --   |
    |     |   XXX  |  |    /    /
    +-----+   XXX  \--/   |   --

Fills
-----

Upper case characters generate shapes with borders, lower case without border.
Fills must be at least two characters wide or high. (This reduces the chance
that it is detected as Fill instead of a string)

.. aafigure::

    A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M
     AA  BB  CC  DD  EE  FF  GG  HH  II  JJ  KK  LL  MM
     AA  BB  CC  DD  EE  FF  GG  HH  II  JJ  KK  LL  MM

     aa  bb  cc  dd  ee  ff  gg  hh  ii  jj  kk  ll  mm
     aa  bb  cc  dd  ee  ff  gg  hh  ii  jj  kk  ll  mm

    N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z
     NN  OO  PP  QQ  RR  SS  TT  UU  VV  WW  XX  YY  ZZ
     NN  OO  PP  QQ  RR  SS  TT  UU  VV  WW  XX  YY  ZZ

     nn  oo  pp  qq  rr  ss  tt  uu  vv  ww  xx  yy  zz
     nn  oo  pp  qq  rr  ss  tt  uu  vv  ww  xx  yy  zz

Complex shapes can be filled:

.. aafigure::

    CCCCC     C         dededede
     C  CCCC  CC        dededede
     CC    CCCCC        dededede

Text
----
The images may contain text too. There are different styles to enter text:

*direct*

By default are repeated characters detected as fill::

    Hello World  dd d
                    d

.. aafigure::

    Hello World  dd d
                    d

*quoted*

Text between quotes has priority over any graphical meaning::

    "Hello World"  dd d
                      d

.. aafigure::

    "Hello World"  dd d
                      d

``"``, ``'`` and ``\``` are all valid quotation marks. The quotes are not
visible in the resulting image. This not only disables fills (see below), it
also treats ``-``, ``|`` etc. as text.

*textual option*

The ``:textual:`` option disables horizontal fill detection. Fills are only
detected when they are vertically at least 2 characters high::

    Hello World  dd d
                    d

.. aafigure::
    :textual:

    Hello World  dd d
                    d

TODO
====

- Symbol detection: scan for predefined shapes in the ASCII image
  and output them as symbol from a library

- Symbol libraries for UML, flowchart, electronic schematics, ...

- The way the image is embedded is a hack (inserting a tag trough a raw node...)

- Search for ways to bring in color. Ideas:

    - have an :option: to set color tags. Shapes that touch such a tag
      inherit it's color. The tag would be visible in the ASCII source tough::

        .. aafigure::
            :colortag: 1:red, 2:blue

            1--->  --->2

    - ``:color: x,y,color`` but counting coordinates is no so fun

    drawback: both are complex to implement, searching for shapes that belong
    together. It's also not always wanted that e.g. when a line touches a
    box, both have the same color

- aafigure probably needs arguments like ``font-family``, ...

- Punctuation not included in strings (now a bit improved but if it has a
  graphical meaning , then that is chooses, even if it makes no sense),
  underlines in strings are tricky to detect...

- Dotted lines? ``...``

- Group shapes that belong to an object, so that it's easier to import and
  change the graphics in a vector drawing program.

- Path optimizer, it happens that many small lines are output where a long
  line could be used.

- Diodes OK

- Caps not optimal. Too far apart in image, not very good recognisable in
  ASCII. Space cannot be removed as the two ``+`` signs would be connected
  otherwise. The schematic below uses an other style.

- Arrows in transistor symbols can not be drawn
