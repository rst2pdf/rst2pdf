=======================================
rst2pdf: Use a text editor. Make a PDF.
=======================================

The usual way of creating PDF from reStructuredText is by going through LaTeX.
This tool provides an alternative by producing PDF directly using the ReportLab
library.

More information is available at the `main website <https://rst2pdf.org>`_.

Option 1: Install from PyPI (pipx)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest released version may be installed from PyPI by using ``pipx``::

    $ pipx install rst2pdf

rst2pdf also has support for a number of features that require additional dependencies. Installation of all the
required dependencies using ``pipx`` may be installed using::

    $ pipx install rst2pdf[aafiguresupport,mathsupport,plantumlsupport,rawhtmlsupport,sphinx,svgsupport]

Option 2: Install from PyPI (uv)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with ``pipx`` above, the latest released version may be installed from PyPI by using
`uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv>`_::

    $ uv tool install rst2pdf

If you don't have ``uv``, please see `the installation docs <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_

Installation of all the required dependencies using ``uv`` may be installed using::

    $ uv tool install rst2pdf[aafiguresupport,mathsupport,plantumlsupport,rawhtmlsupport,sphinx,svgsupport]

Option 3: Install from Snap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using a system that supports `snaps <https://snapcraft.io/>`__
then you can install from there with::

    $ snap install rst2pdf

Option 4: Install from GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Work on rst2pdf has restarted on GitHub, with the goals of adding new
features, addressing outstanding issues, and not breaking anything. You
can clone the repository and install this version::

    $ git clone https://github.com/rst2pdf/rst2pdf
    $ cd rst2pdf
    $ git checkout <desired-branch> # if you want something other than main
    $ uv tool install .[aafiguresupport,mathsupport,plantumlsupport,rawhtmlsupport,sphinx,svgsupport]

If you intend to work on rst2pdf's source code, see `doc/DEVELOPERS <doc/DEVELOPERS.rst>`_.

Usage
-----

To convert a reStructuredText document to a PDF, simply run::

    $ rst2pdf <document name> output.pdf

For information on available options, use ``-h``::

    $ rst2pdf -h

To enable basic integration with Sphinx, modify your ``conf.py`` file to enable
the ``rst2pdf.pdfbuilder`` extension and configure the ``pdf_documents``
option. For example::

    extensions = [
        # ...
        'rst2pdf.pdfbuilder',
    ]

    # Grouping the document tree into PDF files. List of tuples
    # (source start file, target name, title, author, options).
    pdf_documents = [
        ('index', 'MyProject', 'My Project', 'Author Name'),
    ]

For information on the ``pdf_documents`` option and the many other options
available, refer to the `manual <https://rst2pdf.org/static/manual.pdf>`_.
