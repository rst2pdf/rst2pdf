This is basically a copy of test_issue_138, modified to use a bigger figure, and a larger border padding size.

This test shows that the math on size and location calculations for the border and the figure within the border are not correct.

This is the default figure class without a border (which seems right):

.. figure:: images/text_and_vectors_001.pdf

   This is the caption.

   And this is the legend.
This is a line after the figure, just to show where things are.

This is a figure with ``with-border`` class (which is broken at the time of this report):

.. class:: with-border
.. figure:: images/text_and_vectors_001.pdf

   This is the caption.

   And this is the legend.

This is a line after the figure, just to show where things are.
